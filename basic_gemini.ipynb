      "### 1. Two Potential Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Regulatory & Permitting Hurdles for Scalability:** The solution's core lies in integrating with *existing parking meters*, which means navigating complex municipal regulatory and permitting processes. Each city has its own unique set of bylaws, utility requirements, and political landscape. While success in Boston is positive, replicating this across the top 10 US cities (or even one more) can be a slow, costly, and unpredictable bottleneck, significantly delaying expansion and increasing customer acquisition costs for new cities.\n",
      "*   **Hardware Production & Supply Chain Reliance:** 60% of the seed round is allocated to hardware production. This indicates a capital-intensive model heavily reliant on manufacturing, potentially including proprietary components. Risks include unexpected increases in production costs, quality control issues at scale, intellectual property protection challenges, and significant exposure to global supply chain disruptions for components, all of which could impact deployment timelines and profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Three Follow-up Questions for Due Diligence\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Regulatory & City Expansion Strategy:** \"Given your reliance on city infrastructure, what are the specific regulatory and permitting challenges you've faced in Boston, and what's your detailed strategy for navigating these processes to replicate success in new cities? Can you provide examples of your current agreements with Boston, and how you plan to leverage your parking operator partnerships to streamline approvals and utility interconnection in new markets?\"\n",
      "*   **Unit Economics & Hardware Scalability:** \"Can you provide a detailed breakdown of the unit economics for a single EcoCharge pod, including its manufacturing cost, installation cost, expected lifespan, and projected monthly revenue and profit margin per pod? How many pods do you anticipate producing with the $2M seed round, and what are your specific plans and contingencies to mitigate supply chain risks and achieve cost-effective manufacturing at scale?\"\n",
      "*   **Competitive Landscape & Moat:** \"Beyond the convenience of integration with parking meters, what is the core technological or operational differentiator of your 'smart urban charging pods' that provides a sustainable competitive advantage? How do you envision the competitive landscape evolving in urban EV charging, and how will EcoCharge maintain its lead against potential new entrants (e.g., parking meter manufacturers adding charging, utility companies) or larger incumbents in the long term?\"\n"
